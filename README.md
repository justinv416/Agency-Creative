## IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT HTML/SASS STRUCTURE AND MEDIA QUERIES

This project is built with BEM methodology and thus, styles in SASS are nested using the '&' selector. 

Another thing I would like to address is that I have chosen to nest media queries within the individual components/elements themselves. The reasoning behind this decision is that I personally, find this approach to be better for maintainability as I can understand what needs to be changed at certain breakpoints. I understand that this may not be the best approach for certain situations, such as large scale applications where this approach could potentially be a determent to maintainability and that while it is more easily maintainable for myself that may not be the case for others who I may be collaborating with. I am also aware that this may not be the most 'DRY' approach and that it can thus, 'bloat' the CSS file and impact performance. I have attempted to rewrite media queries to a more traditional style but due to time constraints I was unable to continue. 

If there are any concerns with any of these two approaches I would absolutely love the feedback.

Thanks for reading, 

Justin
